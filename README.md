# Branched-Project-Zone
This repository is a branch-controlled project hub to share ideas and projects.
To be able to share and access projects on this hub, please ask for collaborator priveldges.

Each project is accessible for all collaborators.

To make a project, make a new branch off master.
Name it Project-#
Replace the # with the number of projects in the repository, then add 1.

Each script you want in your project, just make a file: Code-#
Replace # with a letter- start with A, then move on to Z for each project added.
